I found myself having to compare pages quite often when upgrading legacy web applications. Often the urls were very similar, but the hostname changed or an extra param was added. In order to speed up the process, I made a little chrome extension that would read the current url, get all the variations of the url I wanted to compare, and open them in new tabs.  

The example in the README uses stack exchange sites, since they mostly follow the same url pattern, but have different host names.
