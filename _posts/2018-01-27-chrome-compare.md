I found myself having to compare pages quite often when upgrading legacy web applications.  
Often the urls were very similar, but the hostname changed or one extra componenet was added.  
In order to speed up copy-pasting and editing, 
I made a simple javascript chrome extension to do that work in one click.  

The example in the README uses stack exchange sites, since they mostly follow the same url
pattern, but have different host names.
