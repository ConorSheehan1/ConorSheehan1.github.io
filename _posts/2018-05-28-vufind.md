VuFind is a library resource portal designed and developed for libraries by libraries.  

As part of my work at the NLI I found a bug in vufind.  
I had to patch it for the NLI vufind instance, so I opened a pull request with the same patch.  
Demian, the core maintainer helped port it to two major releases!  
[https://github.com/vufind-org/vufind/pull/1185](https://github.com/vufind-org/vufind/pull/1185)  

Although the pull request was closed, the commits were merged [here](https://github.com/vufind-org/vufind/commits?author=ConorSheehan1)

My first merged open source contribution. Hopefully the first of many!
