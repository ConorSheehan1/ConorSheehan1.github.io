VuFind is a library resource portal designed and developed for libraries by libraries.  

As part of my work at the [NLI](https://www.nli.ie) I needed to make a small change to the codebase.  
Demian, the core maintainer ported it to two major releases.  
[https://github.com/vufind-org/vufind/pull/1185](https://github.com/vufind-org/vufind/pull/1185)  

You can see my commits 
[here](https://github.com/vufind-org/vufind/commits?author=ConorSheehan1).

My first merged open source contribution. Hopefully the first of many!
