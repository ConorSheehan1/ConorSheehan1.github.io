I recently published [shot](https://github.com/ConorSheehan1/shot), which stands for: **S**creenshot **H**elper for **O**SX **T**erminal.  
It a python CLI that I use day to day to copy / move / rename screenshots and videos.
I also created a [much smaller bash implementation](https://gist.github.com/ConorSheehan1/2a72b13fa530388dcaec93307f4f7b09) first.

I learned a lot about python packaging from building [osxdocker](/personal/2020/09/21/osxdocker.html), and decided not to publish this package to pypi since it's Mac/OSX specific. Instead I created [a homebrew tap](https://github.com/ConorSheehan1/homebrew-ConorSheehan1) to make it easy to install on mac, like this:  
* `brew install conorsheehan1/conorsheehan1/shot`

It can still be installed via pip, just not from pypi. It can be pip installed from github like this:  
* `pip install https://github.com/ConorSheehan1/shot/releases/latest/download/shot.tar.gz`

All installation options are listed at [https://github.com/ConorSheehan1/shot#install](https://github.com/ConorSheehan1/shot#install)  
I've found it fairly useful and I hope someone else will too.
