Sadly [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) is [sunsetting](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/415293/sunsetting-jobs-developer-story) multiple services including jobs and developer story tomorrow.
I've archived my developer story [here](/static/stack-overflow-cv.html).

Hopefully it's an [april fools joke](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/415589/6305204). They've made [plenty in the past](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/406512/what-are-the-past-april-fools-jokes) but this seems more serious so I've archived my page anyway.

Edit from the future: it wasn't a joke :(
