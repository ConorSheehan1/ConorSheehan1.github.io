I've started blogging over at [https://dev.to/conorsheehan1](https://dev.to/conorsheehan1).  
I guess this site could be considered a blog, but I like a lot of the features dev has and wanted to post there too.
I'll still document my projects here, but general blog posts will be on [dev.to](https://dev.to/conorsheehan1) too.

Edit from the future: I've also started posting at [https://conorsheehan1.hashnode.dev](https://conorsheehan1.hashnode.dev).
All posts can be found here, but there may be conversations on the other sites.

I followed [this great post](https://dev.to/aussieguy/add-rss-to-github-pages-and-link-it-to-dev-to-16mo) to set up a RSS feed so a subset of the posts I make here with a specific tag are push out to dev.to and hashnode as well.
